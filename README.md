Hi, iam Ziad Abu Hashima Known as Z3roX

👨‍💻 About Me

I am an aspiring cybersecurity researcher focused on penetration testing and vulnerability analysis. I learn by doing: practicing labs, writing reports, and building small scripts that help automate basic tasks. My goal is to develop a solid practical foundation and improve my understanding of the full attack cycle—from reconnaissance to documentation.

🎯 Goals

Strengthen my penetration testing skills

Build small hands-on security projects

Improve my Python and Linux knowledge

Publish clear and structured write-ups

Create a practical portfolio that reflects real skills


📁 Repository Structure

1) Write-ups

Educational and safe write-ups from training labs showing:

Reconnaissance

Result analysis

Basic exploitation in training environments

Privilege escalation (lab-only)

Clear reporting and documentation


2) Simple Scripts

Small utilities I build to automate tasks such as:

Basic information gathering

Data parsing

Organizing workflow steps
(All scripts are educational and not intended for harmful use.)


3) Small Projects

Mini penetration-testing projects or lab notes that demonstrate:

My thought process

How I approach problems

How I analyze vulnerabilities

How I document findings


🛠 Skills I’m Developing

Linux fundamentals

Python for security

Networking basics

Intro to web security

Writing clear security reports
